## Aztec OTC Contract

This is a sample OTC contract implemented with Aztec.nr - https://aztec.network/aztec-nr/ for the Alpha program.

The structure of the OTC contract contains two tokens, a sell token and the settlement token. Users can create sell offers using the sell token and buyers can browse through unfulfilled sell offers and accept an offer, paying in the settlement token.

The repository will be updated to eventually include end-to-end tests and the smart contracts are not in a final state.

You will need to install Aztec Sandbox - https://docs.aztec.network/developers/getting_started/quickstart to deploy the OTC smart contract locally.
You can refer to the documentation for additional steps.
